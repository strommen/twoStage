## [TwoStage](http://joestrommen.com/twoStage)

TwoStage is a client-server technique to make dynamic web pages publicly cacheable.  This allows them to load extremely fast by serving them from a CDN or a caching reverse proxy.

More information is available at [joestrommen.com/twoStage](http://www.joestrommen.com/twoStage).
